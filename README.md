JsonPP
======

A C++ Library providing a `std::string` parser for JavaScript Object Notation aka JSON.
The STL containers are in favor to represent the Json entities: Object, Array and Value.

Requirements
------------
C++17 standard is required to compile the library. 
Also cmake is recommended for building and installation.

Build and Install
-----------------
Use the default cmake procedure to build and install the library on your system.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ccdMuro/JsonPP.git
cmake -B bld_jsonpp -S JsonPP
cmake --build bld_jsonpp
sudo cmake --install bld_jsonpp
```

Use in your project
-------------------
Add these lines to your CMakeLists.txt (*maybe adjust the target signature*):
```cmake
find_package(ccdJsonpp 1.0 REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} PUBLIC ccdJsonpp)
```

Code Example
------------
### Simple value access:
Serialisation into `std::iostream` build in.
```cpp
std::cout << jsonObject["userData"] << "\n";
```
---
Verify type.
```cpp
if ( jsonObject["userData"].type() == Ccd::Json::ValueType::Object)
{
	// ...
}
```
---
Access the object values with the subscript operator[],
with the access method or an explicit cast
```cpp
auto msgId_a = jsonObject["messageID"].toInt();
auto msgId_b = static_cast<int>(jsonObject["messageID"]);
```
---
Write/Assign values.
```cpp
jsonObject["timeStamp"] = secondsSinceEpoch;
```

### Array value access: 
STL container `std::vector` is used as Ccd::Json::Array backend.
Write loops as usual.
```cpp
for ( const auto& attribute : jsonObject["attributes"].toArray() ) {
	// ...
}
```

### Build Objects from scratch
```cpp
auto jsonObject = Ccd::Json::Object {};
jsonObject["colors"] = { "red", "green", "blue" };
jsonObject["user"] = Ccd::Json::Object{
	{"name","alice"},
	{"age",20},
	{"size",1.90},
	{"hobbies", { "reading", "rock music" }}
};
```

### Parse a `std::string`
```cpp
auto jsonObject = Ccd::Json::objectFromString(JSONstring);
```

### Example Code
Some working examples can be found in the `example` folder.

## == We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project. 

This project has been migrated to [codeberg.org](https://codeberg.org/muro/JsonPP).

We urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign from
[the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand
some of the reasons why GitHub is not a good place to host FOSS projects.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
